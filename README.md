In this assignment, you will build a na√Øve Bayes and a logistic regression classifier for sentiment
classification. We are defining sentiment classification as two classes: positive and negative.
Our data set consists of movie reviews. The zip directory for the data contains training and test
datasets, where each file contains one movie review. You will build the model using training
data and evaluate with test data. Training data contains 25000 reviews and test data contains
25000 reviews. <br>
